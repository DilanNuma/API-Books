API-BOOKS
It is a software with typescript that allows consuming an API of books, where it is possible to processes of query, insertion, update and deletion of data,
also sending params and / or query params, headers. For the elaboration of this software, classes, interfaces and the best programming practices were used.

The software has a login where you must enter the username and password provided by the TL, Administrator Profile (email:  password: C0ntr4S3gu++r4). 
provided by the TL, Administrator Profile (email: prueba@prueba.pru password:C0ntr4S3gu++r4)

Once logged in, the main page has a nav where there is an anchor element “a” called “books” that redirects to the location where the added books are located, and an exit button to leave this interface and redirect to the login.

Then, there is a form with which you can add and update books. This form has the title, author, description, summary and publication date of the book, followed by a button to save the data, either to add or update. For each interaction with the software buttons, an alert popup is displayed indicating the action taken (adding, updating and deleting a book).

In the middle-bottom part of the page, you can visualize the previously added books, organized in cards for each book. Each card contains the book data (title, author, description, summary and date of publication). Also, on each card, there is an “edit” and “delete” button that performs the corresponding action.

This software has an intuitive and minimalist interface, with colors justly striking and associated with the action performed by each one, in addition to this, the interface is responsive, allowing the visualization and interaction in different screen sizes.
